Description: The algorithm implemented in this package was
    designed to quickly estimates the distribution of the 
    log-rank especially for heavy unbalanced groups. VALORATE 
    estimates the null distribution and the p-value of the 
    log-rank test based on a recent formulation. For a given 
    number of alterations that define the size of survival 
    groups, the estimation involves a weighted sum of 
    distributions that are conditional on a co-occurrence term 
    where mutations and events are both present. The estimation 
    of conditional distributions is quite fast allowing the 
    analysis of large datasets in few minutes
